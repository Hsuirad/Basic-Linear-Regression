i started watching CS229 with andrew ng because hes awesome. first lecture was on LMS algo for linear regression so i wanted to code it to get the idea down better. in the lecture he said just make alpha 0.01 and start from there, but for larger data sets on a stochastic gradient descent i saw that you need an increasingly small alpha for an increasingly large data set
